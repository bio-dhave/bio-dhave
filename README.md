# Hi there, I'm Dave ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working as a PhD student at University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy, in the Materials for Health, Environment and Energy program. I'm a bioinformatician, working especially in the structural bioinformatic field. 

ðŸ§¬ It's the central dogma of biology: the structure-function one. Well, my work is focused on the simulation of proteins and/or nucleic acids (DNAs,RNAs) to better understand how the structure changes influence the specific function.

ðŸ˜º [Here](https://github.com/bio-dhave/bio-dhave/blob/main/cv_dp.pdf) it is my curriculum vitae!
