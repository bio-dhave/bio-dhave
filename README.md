# Hi there, I'm Dave ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working as a PhD student at University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy, in the Materials for Health, Environment and Energy program. I'm a bioinformatician, working especially in the structural bioinformatic field. 

ðŸ§¬ It's the central dogma of biology: the structure-function one. Well, my work is to simulate proteins and nucleic acids (DNAs,RNAs) to understand how the structure changes influence that function.
